
Instruction For Linux, running CMUCL
====================================

Install CMUCL, eg:
    apt-get install cmucl

CD to the directory containing Genifer, eg:
    (setf default-directory "/Genifer/")

Load the main program:
    (load "main.lisp")

Set garbage collection verbosity (otherwise there will be annoying messages):
    (setf ext:*gc-verbose* nil)

Run the program:
    (main)

Note:  I develop the code in CLISP, so testing in CMUCL is occasional.
       Please tolerate if it doesn't work on CMUCL, or report to me.
