;;; 1. using rules in the abductive direction
;;; 2. abduction

;;; ************************************* intro *****************************************
;;; All truth values are formated as (Z . confidence)
;;; All rules are all of the form:
;;;     ((head) (body))
;;; where
;;;     (head) = (predicate arg1 arg2 ...)
;;; note:  the # of args can be 0
;;; and
;;;     (body) = (op X1 X2)
;;; where op is an operator such as 'Z-AND (fuzzy AND)
;;; and X1, X2, ... etc can invoke other operators recursively

;;; For example:
;;;     smart <- creative \/ humorous
;;;     smart(?X) <- creative(?X) \/ humorous(?X)
;;; can be expressed as a Z rule as:
;;;     ((smart ?X) ('Z-OR (creative ?X) (humorous ?X)))

;;; The best-frist search algorithm can be implemented using call-by-continuations which
;;; allows remembering the search state, but we don't use that here.  We simply maintain
;;; the priority queue.

;;; define some parameters:
(defparameter max-depth 7)            ; maximum search depth
(defparameter max-rule-length 10)     ; rule length = # of arguments it has
(defparameter W0 50.0)                ; constant used in calculating confidence from w
(defparameter abduction-penalty 0.5)  ; < 1.0;  used to reduce the scores of abductive steps
(defparameter facts-boost       2.0)  ; > 1.0;  increases the scores of facts
(defparameter args-decay        0.8)  ; < 1.0;  decreases the scores of consecutive args in a rule
(defparameter testing-decay     0.98) ; < 1.0;  decreases scores of successive literal tests

;;; Proof tree is a tree with back-links so we can go from a child node to its parent node.

;;; Each tree node has a pointer to its parent.
;;; A sub-goal node contains a list in its "node-data" slot:
;;;     (sub-goal (child node1) (child node2) ...)
;;; A rule node contains a rule class item (see below) in the "node-data" slot;
;;; It has the following elements:
;;;     operator confidence literal1 [literal2...] [params...]
;;; where literal1,2,... are proof tree nodes and each has a pointer pointing to _this_ node.
;;; A fact node contains the fact (as a list) in its "data" slot;

;;; 2.     Remove first item from priority list (the item points to a node in the proof tree)
;;; 3.     Go to the proof tree and process the node;
;;;            This results in some new child nodes of the proof tree node
;;; 4.     Put the new nodes into priority queue (via ranking-based merging)
;;; ===============================================
;;; About the scoring of the priority list:
;;;    There are 3 types of items in the priority list:  subgoals, rules, and facts;
;;;    Each has some factors that can be taken into consideration when calculating the score:
;;;    A. rule -- length, confidence, depth
;;;    B. fact -- confidence, depth
;;;    C. subgoal -- order within its rule, assuming most-significant first
